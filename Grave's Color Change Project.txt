As a user, I want…


A simple but aesthetically pleasing design.


The page to be mobile responsive


The page to be composed of three different colors (primary, secondary, and tertiary) or values of colors (mid tone, light, dark)


To be able to use the color picker to either pick one color and automatically adjust the tones accordingly


A copy of the hex codes and rgba codes of the color(s) I’ve chosen to be displayed and available.


To be able to select all three colors for primary, secondary, and tertiary values myself.  


To be able to save my color schemes and reselect them to compare (save to local storage and delete on unmount of app).


To be able to upload an SVG image or SVG link and be able to set the color of it to see if it matches my theme






As a developer, I want…


Only one local storage item to be used


File structure to make sense and be easy to follow


In line notes to be able to follow any functions that don’t make sense at first glance


Components to not exceed 200 linesS
